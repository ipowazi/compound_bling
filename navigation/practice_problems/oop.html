						<td class="answer_hide">Local variables can only be accessed in a given method.<br />Instance variables are also known as object variables (i.e. @method) and have scope within the current object.<br />Class variables (i.e. @@method) can be accessed within the class.<br />Global variables (i.e. $x) can be accessed anywhere, including in classes and objects.</td>

If you do not classify a method as a class method, then Ruby treats it as an instance method.

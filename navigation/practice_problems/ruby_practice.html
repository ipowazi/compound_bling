				<h2>x = [1, 2, 3]  Determine if x includes the string "y"</h2>
				<div class = "answer"><p>x.include?("y")  <br />remember, the question mark is used because the include? method returns a boolean</p></div>


				<h2>Use two techniques to return the last element in an array.</h2>
				<div class = "answer"><p>x.last  OR  x[-1]</p></div>

				<h2>x = [1, 2, 3]  puts the first two elements of the array and separate them with a hyphen</h2>

				<h2>animals = {:cat=>"feline animal", :dog=>"canine animal"}  puts the number of key/value pairs in the hash.</h2>
				<div class = "answer"><p>animals.length  OR  animals.size</p></div>

				<h2>Why are there two different methods to determine the number of key value pairs in a hash?</h2>
				<div class = "answer"><p>Ruby's philosophy is that there should be many ways to solve the same problem.  Other languages, like Python, think that there should only be one way (or only one best way) to solve a problem (the Pythonic way).  Rails seems to be much more opinionated than Ruby.</p></div>

				<div class = "answer"><p>animals[:cat] = "fluffy animal"</p></div>

				<h2>x = {:a => 1, :b => 2}  Iterate through the hash and puts "key equals value" (i.e. :a equals 1, :b equals 2). </h2>

				<h2>Set the age variable to 22 and puts "You are 22" if age is 22 and "You are not 22" otherwise using the ternary operator.</h2>
				<div class = "answer"><p>age == 22 ? "You are 22" : "You are not 22"</p></div>


				<h2>Print every capital letter from A to Z.</h2>
				<div class = "answer"><p>("A".."Z").to_a.each {|letter| puts letter}  OR ("A".."Z").each {|letter| puts letter}</p></div>

				<h2>a = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]  puts the second through fourth element in the array.</h2>

				<div class = "answer"><p>paragraph.scan(/[.?!]/).length  OR paragraph.split(/\.|\?|!/).length  //. and ? need to be escaped because they have other meaning in REGEX (! doesn't need to be escaped).  The pipes (|) mean that . ? and ! are treated separately.</p></div>

				<h2>Iterate through all lowercase letters and delete all letters in the array that are vowels.</h2>
				<div class = "answer"><p>letters = ("a".."z").to_a <br />  vowels = %w{a e i o u}  <br /> answer = letters.select {|letter| !vowels.include?(letter)}  <br />OR  letters.delete_if {|letter| vowels.include?(letter)}</p></div>

				<h2>How are the collect and map Array methods referred to in the Ruby documentation?</h2>
				<div class = "answer"><p>Array#collect <br /> Array#map</p></div>

				<h2>How can you write a really big number to make it more readable (i.e. how can you write 1000000000 to make it more readable)?</h2>
				<div class = "answer"><p>1_000_000_000</p></div>

				<h2>In what order are chained methods evaluated?</h2>
				<div class = "answer"><p>Chained methods are evaluated from left to right</p></div>

				<h2>Show the two methods for using the + operator and explain syntactic sugar.</h2>
				<div class = "answer"><p>5 + 3  OR  5.+(3)  The first technique is an example of syntactic sugar - a break from the normal formatting convention (i.e. a break from dot notation) to make the code more readable and writable.</p></div>

				<h2>puts a random number between 0 and 5</h2>
				<div class = "answer"><p>rand(6)  OR  rand(0..5)</p></div>

				<h2 class="interests_h2">Programming</h2>
				<p>Programming is fun, challenging, and creative.  I started programming with Python and switched to Ruby/Rails a few months ago.  After gaining a solid understanding of Ruby/Rails, I plan to learn Lisp and C.</p>
				<p>Here are some things I would like to build: unbeatable tic-tac-toe game, mortgage amortization calculator, after-tax investment calculator, and a crossword puzzle creator.</p>
				<p>These are my favorite programming books.</p>

				<p>Books I am very excited to read:</p>
				<p>

				<h2 class="interests_h2">Stock Market</h2>
				<p>The stock market is a rational and irrational beast and it is fun to stay up to date with the ebbs and flows.  Here are my favorite books on the market.</p>
				<p>
					<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Irrational-Exuberance-Robert-J-Shiller/dp/0767923634"><img src = "../images/irrational_exuberance.jpg" title = "Irrational Exuberance" width = "100" height = "150"/></a>

				<h2>Economics</h2>
				<p>I try to stay current on economics issues by reading blogs from prominent economists (not newspapers).  I used to be better about staying up to date, but have fallen off recently as I have become obsessed with programming.  Here are my favorite blogs:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/">Paul Krugman</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/">Greg Mankiw</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/">Marginal Revolution</a></li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Housing</h2>
				<p>I think the housing landscape will change as we run out of oil / gas prices increase, water becomes scarce in certain areas, the population ages, and the Fed's purchases of fixed income securities to keep interest rates at historic lows tapers off.  I am very interested in keeping up to date on trends and researching cash flow positive properties in neighborhoods that will thrive in the future economic landscape.  The <a href="http://www.doctorhousingbubble.com/">Doctor Housing Bubble Blog</a> is my favorite.</p>

				<h2>Peak Oil</h2>
				<p>The earth is not creating any more fossil fuels and humans are consuming these fuels at an increasing pace.  If humans continue to consume fossil fuels, we will eventually run out.  Some geologists think we have already consumed half of the oil in the earth and I think their arguments are compelling - here are my favorite books:</p>
				<p>
					<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Oil-View-Hubberts-Peak/dp/080902957X"><img src = "../images/hubberts_peak.jpg" title = "The View from Hubbert's Peak" width = "100" height = "150"/></a>  

					<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Out-Gas-End-Age-Oil/dp/0393326470"><img src = "../images/out-of-gas.jpg" title = "Out of Gas" width = "100" height = "150"/></a>  

				</p>				

				<h2>Astronomy</h2>		
				<p>We live in a universe that is potentially infinite and may contain other earthlike planets with earthlike humans or unearthlike planets with full-blown aliens.  The closest solar system is light years away, so it is unlikely that we will ever figure out all the mysteries of the universe.  Humans in their current form have only been around for 50,000 years.  If the human race is to survive the coming supernova of our sun (which is really far away), we will need to move to other planets.  I don't know much about astronomy, but the topic facinates me.</p>
